Instead of a final exam, you will have a **final code review** during finals week. Here are some details regarding how your final code review will be handled.

## Appointments
{: .page-header }

Final code reviews are conducted during finals week from **Monday May 16th to Wednesday May 18th** between 11:15am and 6:00pm Pacific Time. Each final code review appointment is **30 minutes** each.

Students must sign up for an appointment using the **Canvas scheduler**. Look for "Final Code Review" on the calendar. Appointments will be released gradually in batches.

Any enrolled students may sign up for an appointment regardless of how much progress on projects they have made. Students do not need to have an approved GitHub pull request to sign up for this final code review appointment.

The final code review is *optional*; students that do not have a final code review appointment will receive a 0 for any remaining incomplete project assignments.

**Treat your appointment like a final exam**; students that miss their appointment do not get another opportunity and will receive a 0 for any incomplete project grades that required code review. Make sure to check the time zone being used by your Canvas calendar!

## Deadlines
{: .page-header }

The **project cutoff deadline** determines which projects will be graded in the final code review appointment. **The project cutoff deadline is Sunday, May 15th at 11:59pm**{: .has-text-danger }.

Specifically, to influence which project(s) will be graded in the final code review appointment, students must have the appropriate grade issues successfully created (error-free) in GitHub by this deadline. *It is not necessary to have the grade entered in Canvas by this deadline, however.*

**THIS IS A FIRM DEADLINES.**{: .has-text-danger } There are no extensions available for this specific deadline, which determines what will be graded in your final code review appointment. However, other project extensions are available (see below).

For example, if you create a grade issue at 12:03am after the deadline, it will NOT influence which projects you have graded in your final code review appointment.

The project cutoff deadline balances fairness for students that have an earlier final code review appointment while still allowing for some progress to be made up until the final code review appointment.

#### Code Review Requests

Students that successfully create an error-free code review request on GitHub by **Tuesday, May 10th** will be guaranteed one normal code review before the project cutoff deadline. (It does *not* guarantee a specific time or that students will pass the code review, however.)

Any code review requests made after this point are *not* guaranteed to be fulfilled by the project cutoff deadline. For example, students cannot request a code review on Friday 5/13 and expect it to be completed in time to meet the deadline. Similarly, students cannot expect to have more than one code review that week.

## Grading
{: .page-header }

Unlike all other code reviews, students may receive **partial** project grades on the eligible assignments during the final project code review.

The project assignments students will have graded during the final code review depends on the **first incomplete project grade** after the project cutoff deadline as follows:

  - Students withOUT a non-zero **Project 2 Final Release** grade may earn partial grades on the Project 2 Final Release and Project 3 Tests assignments. *Otherwise, ...*

  - Students withOUT a non-zero **Project 3 Tests** grade may earn partial grades on the Project 3 Tests and Project 3 Final Release assignments. *Otherwise, ...*

  - Students withOUT a non-zero **Project 3 Final Release** grade may earn partial grades Project 3 Final Release and Project 4 Tests assignments. *Otherwise, ...*

  - Students WITH a non-zero **Project 3 Final Release** grade may earn partial grades Project 4 Tests assignment and Project 4 Review assignment.

Late penalties still apply to any partial grades over 74%. Partial grades will be determined as follows:

  - For Project Tests assignments, partial grades will be determined by which tests are passing by the appointment.

  - For Project Final Release assignments, partial grades will be determined by the number of major design issues remaining in the code.

Students that are missing one of the associated Project Review assignments may also earn credit for that review during the final code review appointment if they have a release that passes the necessary checks. For example, students missing the "Project 3 Final Release" and "Project 3 Review 2" grades may earn full credit for "Project 3 Review 2" by attending the final code review appointment with a release that is eligible for code review. However, students may only earn credit for one missing review assignment.

## Extensions
{: .page-header }

I will consider project extension requests, allowing for work to be graded after your final code review appointment. See below for details.

### Student Eligibility

These extensions are primarily for students that are close to passing the course by their final code review appointment. Students must be meeting both the exam and project pass requirements before the request will be approved.

### Project Eligibility

**Code review appointments are not available after the end of finals week.** This means extensions are not available for project grades requiring a code review, which includes the final [Project 4 Search Engine](project-4b.html) project.

However, extensions may be requested for eligible project test grade assignments. Students may still only work 1 project ahead, but this will include any additional progress made in the final code review. This is most commonly used to submit Project 4 Tests after the final code review appointment.

Late penalties will still apply for any project grades over 74%.

### Project Extra Credit

Students may also request to complete [project extra credit](extra-credit.html) as part of the extension as well. This can help offset some late penalties and other deductions. However, it will only help if students are *close* (within 1-3 percentage points) to a passing letter grade.

### Extension Requests

These requests must be made in a private post **within 24 hours *after* the final code review** appointment.

Include a brief 1 paragraph justification, which can range from struggles with physical or mental health, disruptions to living circumstances, and even poor planning. I only ask that students are honest about why they ended up behind and need an extension.

### Extension Deadline

The grade deadline is **Thursday, May 26th**; this is the non-extendable university deadline by which I must enter final letter grades for the semester.

**Therefore the hard deadline for all extensions will be Wednesday, May 25th at 11:59pm**, which gives me 24 hours to wrap up the grading and enter the final letter grades.
