For this project, you will extend your [previous project](project-{{ page.project | minus: 1 }}.html) to create a fully functional search engine. This is the **last project** for this course and is split into two main components:

  - **[Project 4a Web Crawler](project-4a.html)**: Use a work queue to build the index from a seed URL instead of text files. This component will graded using functionality tests only.

  - **[Project 4b Search Engine](project-4b.html)**: Create a search engine web application using Jetty and servlets. This component will be graded in one [final code review](final-review.html) during finals week (if eligible).

The last [search engine](project-4b.html) project has several extra credit opportunities. Students that are not eligible for this project may complete [other extra credit](extra-credit.html) opportunities instead at the end of the semester.

The last code review in this class will be during finals week. Students may earn a partial grade on eligible project assignments during this review. See the [final code review](final-review.html) guide for details.
