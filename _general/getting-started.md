## Lecture Sections

Lectures will be conducted in-person by the instructor, but may be attended in-person or remotely via Zoom by students. The same Zoom meeting will be used for both lecture sections:

| Section | Date/Time | Zoom Meeting |
|:--------|:----------|:-------------|
| CS 272-01 Lecture | Tue/Thu 12:45-2:30p | [{{ site.data.info.streams.lectures.room }}]({{ site.data.info.streams.lectures.link }}) |
| CS 272-02 Lecture | Tue/Thu 04:35-6:20p | [{{ site.data.info.streams.lectures.room }}]({{ site.data.info.streams.lectures.link }}) |
{: class="table is-hoverable" style="width: auto;" }

Students are encouraged to attend lectures in person when possible. However, lectures will be recorded and may be viewed asynchronously by students unable to attend live for any reason. Instructor permission is not required. However, students should expect less engagement and interactivity for remote or asynchronous attendance.

Students may attend either lecture section remotely via Zoom, unless there is a scheduled exam. Students must get instructor approval to attend a different lecture section in person or take the exam at a different time than scheduled.

## Lab Sessions

Labs will be conducted in-person by the instructor during the first several weeks of class. During this time, students may attend lab sessions in-person or remotely via Zoom. The same Zoom meeting will be used for both lab sections:

| Section | Date/Time | Zoom Meeting |
|:--------|:----------|:-------------|
| CS 272L-01 Lab    | Fri 12:45-2:30p | [{{ site.data.info.streams.labs.room }}]({{ site.data.info.streams.labs.link }}) |
| CS 272L-02 Lab    | Fri 3:30-4:35p | [{{ site.data.info.streams.labs.room }}]({{ site.data.info.streams.labs.link }}) |
{: class="table is-hoverable" style="width: auto;" }

Students are strongly encouraged to attend labs synchronously. Since much of lab time will be spent in breakout rooms, labs will not be regularly recorded. Students should attend their enrolled lab session until code reviews begin.

Once code reviews with instructor begin, labs will convert to remote-only teacher assistant office hours. Students may attend either or both lab sections at that time.

## Office Hours

Office hours are first-come first-serve. Office hours will be held primarily remotely via Zoom, using the [same Zoom meeting]({{ site.data.info.streams.lectures.link }}) as lectures and labs. See the pinned "Weekly Schedule" post on [Piazza]({{ site.data.info.links.forums.link }}) for details.

## Subscribe to Calendar

You can subscribe to your Canvas calendar using whatever calendar service you regularly use. The calendar will show the latest deadlines for all the assignments.
