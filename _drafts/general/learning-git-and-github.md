If you do not yet have a free Github account, you need to create one:

<https://github.com/join>

When creating an account for this class (including accounts already created), keep in mind:

- Choose a professional username.

- Add information to your profile, including a professional profile photo and brief bio (including your degree and expected graduation date).

You can see the [instructor's profile page](https://github.com/sjengle) for an example. When done with this class, you'll be able to show off your Github profile to potential employers.

If you are unfamiliar with `git` and GitHub, I recommend watching this workshop put together by two past CS 272 teacher assistants:

- [Git 101 Workshop, Part 1](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~tutoring/git_workshop_part_1.mp4)
- [Git 101 Workshop, Part 2](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~tutoring/git_workshop_part_2.mp4)

Here are some other fantastic guides you can look at to learn more:

- [**GitHub Guides**](https://guides.github.com/)  
  Guides for learning more about GitHub by Github.

- [**GitHub Training and Guides (Videos)**](https://www.youtube.com/githubguides)  
  Videos produced by Github for learning Git and Github.

- [**GitHub Learning Lab**](https://lab.github.com/)  
  Hands-on GitHub lessons taught by the friendly GitHub Learning Lab bot.

- [**Git-SCM**](https://git-scm.com/)  
  Official Git project site (includes tutorials, a reference manual, and the free "Pro Git" ebook).

Here are a couple resources that will help use `git` with Eclipse:

- [**Github and Eclipse (Video)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuuzSaelUzo)  
  Videos produced by Github for using Github with Eclipse.

- [**Eclipse EGit Plugin User Guide**](http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide)  
  User guide for the builtin `git` plugin in Eclipse. Works with Github repositories.

You also have access to [Linkedin Learning](https://myusf.usfca.edu/ets/educational-technologies/linkedin) (formerly Lynda.com), which has many technical online tutorials and mini-courses. If you prefer that format, I strongly encourage you to take a look.

There are *many* other resources you can find with a simple web search. The operations we will use in class include: commit, push, pull, merge, and branch. The GitHub features we will use in class include releases, issues, and pull requests.

Don't just wing it! I recommend you spend some time learning the basics of `git` now, as it is a core skill for anyone in the tech and CS industries. It will also make this class and all CS classes that follow a lot less frustrating.
