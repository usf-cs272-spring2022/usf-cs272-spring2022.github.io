## Modifying Homework Code
{: .page-header }

Refer to the `TODO` comments in the template code for specifics on what code to fill in or modify for the assignment. When modifying this code, keep in mind the following:

  - **Do not modify any method or class declarations.** For example, you cannot add or remove keywords like `static` or add a `throws` keyword to a method if one was not already included.

  - **Do not modify methods that are already fully defined.** For example, if a method is provided and has no `TODO` comments within the method definition, you may not modify that method.

  - **Do not modify the test code.** This includes any input or output files utilized by the test code.

  - You MAY add additional members and methods as needed to the code.

  - You MAY add additional classes and imports for those classes as long as they are a part of core Java or one of the pre-approved third-party libraries (Apache OpenNLP, Apache Commons Text, Apache Log4j2, Jetty, MariaDB).

  - You MAY add comments to clarify code for yourself. You can add comments to already defined methods if you want.

  - You MAY change a `return` statement in a method with a `TODO` comment as needed. (You may *not* change the return type in the method declaration, however.)

  - Remove the `TODO` comments when you are done. This removes them from the "Tasks" view in Eclipse. If you want to keep the comment around, you can change the text `TODO` to `DONE` instead.

## Receiving Homework Credit
{: .page-header }

To receive full credit on any homework assignment, you must:

  - **Pass all of the unit tests remotely.** See the [Testing Homework](/guides/homework/test-homework.html) guide detailed steps. You will not receive full points if you are passing the tests locally but not remotely.

  - **Commit your work often.** Some assignments require a minimum number of commits! Consider making a commit after you complete every `TODO` in the code or after you pass a new test. <i class="fas fa-star has-text-warning"></i>

  - **Avoid warnings.** Some assignments require the code to compile with no warnings to earn full points. Try to make sure your code is warning-free in Eclipse before testing your code remotely!

  - **Follow the `TODO` directions.** For example, if the `TODO` comment stated you must use a `HashSet` and your code does not, you could lose points even if you are passing all of the unit tests.

  - **Properly submit your homework on time.** Remember, there are no late homework submissions unless you apply for a policy exception. See the syllabus for details.

To submit your homework, you must make a commit and push that commit to Github before the deadline!
