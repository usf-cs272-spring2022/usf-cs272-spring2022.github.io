For this project, you will extend your [previous project](project-3.html) to create a fully functional search engine. This is the **last project** for this course and is split into two main components:

  - **[Project 4a Web Crawler](project-4a.html)**: Use a work queue to build the index from a seed URL instead of text files. The eligibility and grading are handled like any other [project functionality](functionality.html) component (i.e. using functionality tests).

  - **[Project 4b Search Engine](project-4b.html)**: Create a search engine web interface using Jetty and servlets. The eligibility and grading are handled like any other [project design](design.html) component (i.e. using code review).

To earn credit for [Project 4a Web Crawler](project-4a.html), you fully must pass the design of [project 2](project-2.html) and functionality of [project 3](project-3.html). To earn credit for [Project 4b Search Engine](project-4b.html), you must fully pass the functionality of [project 4a](project-4a.html).

The code reviews for this project are conducted synchronously during finals week only. See the [Final Code Review](final-review.html) guide for details.
